# vue3-cloud-form
This web sample included a form with 5 fields with autosave ability with Firebase. In this sample I wrote some basic Firebase services without the supplied credentials to get/set data in 'cloud-form' collection with document ID is MinhNguyen.

# Achived target
- Apply all of technical requirements of this assignment:
TailwindCSS for design and UI
Cloud Firestore as database
Vue 3 with Composition API + Typescript
Firebase SDK
- Deploy source code to firebase hosting with demo: [Vue3-CloudForm](https://vue3-cloud-form.firebaseapp.com/)

# Targets yet to be reached
- Cloud function firestore: I have a problem with functions firebase deploy. 
In detail, if I deploy with node engine 8, firebase will announce this command was deprecated. With node 10, firebase required me a billing account so I could not complete this target. 
However, I have already complete functions source.
